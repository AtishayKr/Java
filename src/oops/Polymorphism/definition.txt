Polymorphism => many Forms

Types => 1. Compile Time Polymorphism and 2. Run Time Polymorphism

Compile Time Polymorphism => 1. method Overloading / function Overloading and 2. operator Overloading / 

function Overloading/method overloading=> MULTIPLE methodS sharing a name but differing in argument or argument Types

Operator Overloading => Java does not support user-defined operator overloading but internally overloads certain
operators (eg., + for String concatenation and integer addition)



Run Time Overloading => 
1. Function Overriding => Subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already 
    defined in its superclass
2. Dynamic Method Dispatch [Upcastind] -> A superclass reference variable can refer to a subclass object and dynamic 
    Dispatch is used to resolve the called method at runtime.
